# [Blog Site](https://sams-dev-blog.vercel.app/)

This is my personal blog site that I built. It was always my dream to build my own and finally it is a success. Although other people can also use it.



## Thinking and approach

I used vite as it is much faster than CRA or old react. It is build on top of esbuild which is 90% faster than react. Avoided next js as I am already using a seperate backend. This is full--stack MERN project so I didn't used next Js.  

Users can sign-in (OAuth coming soon...), write blogs in a Rich text editor. See other people's blog also. 

Users can also update their bio, add profile pictures. Posts also has a banner picture upload funtionality.
